% The abstractpage environment sets up everything on the page except
% the text itself.  The title and other header material are put at the
% top of the page, and the advisors are listed at the bottom.  A
% new page is begun both before and after.  Of course, an abstract may
% be more than one page itself.  If you need more control over the
% format of the page, you can use the abstract environment, which puts
% the word "Abstract" at the beginning and single spaces its text.

%% You can either \input (*not* \include) your abstract file, or you can put
%% the text of the abstract directly between the \begin{abstractpage} and
%% \end{abstractpage} commands.

% First copy: start a new page, and save the page number.

% Uncomment the next line if you do NOT want a page number on your
% abstract and acknowledgments pages.
